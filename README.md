# Home-Automation-Sweepstakes
This repository has the Home Automation and Qualcomm DragonBoard™ 410c Sweepstakes files to be used in shows.

A demo to showcase the DB 410c as a home automation enabler and use it to register participants for Qualcomm DragonBoard™ 410c Sweepstakes.

A quick, easy-to-make security camera prototype solution for a home.

# Overview

These are the source files that accompany the security camera project. The

exercise is intended to provide exposure for users of all backgrounds and

experience levels to the Dragonboard.

By the end of the project, you will have a simple security camera that

could be used as a proof-of-concept for home automation. The Dragonboard

will email you a picture of a face that has been detected by a webcam.
